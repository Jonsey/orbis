		<div style="padding-top:10px"><strong>EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES POLICY STATEMENT: </strong></div>
		<div style="padding-top:10px">Orbis Resourcing Ltd entirely supports the principle of equal opportunities in  employment and opposes all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the  grounds of colour, race, nationality, ethnic or national origin, sex, age,  marital status or disability. Orbis Resourcing Ltd believes that it is in the  Company's best interests, and of all who work in it, to ensure that the human resources, talents and skills available are considered when employment opportunities arise. </div>
        
<div style="padding-top:10px">Every possible step will be taken to ensure that individuals are treated equally and fairly and that decisions on  recruitment, selection, training, promotion, career management and provision of other benefits are based solely on objective and job related criteria.</div>
<div style="padding-top:10px">Every employee is required to support this Policy and to ensure that  discrimination does not occur in the workplace. Discriminatory behaviour on any  of the grounds set out in the first paragraph above, or any breach of this  Policy, will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and  including dismissal. </div>
			  <div style="padding-top:10px">Orbis Resourcing Ltd recognises that where  an employee has been a victim of discrimination he/she will find the experience  distressing and stressful. It will thus be for the employee who makes an  allegation of discrimination to choose whether he/she wishes to have the matter  dealt with formally or informally. Where he/she chooses to have the matter  dealt with informally, such will be dealt with under the Policy against  Harassment on the informal basis. Where he/she chooses to have the matter dealt  with formally, such will be dealt with under the formal Grievance Procedure  and, where evidence of misconduct arises, under the Disciplinary Procedure.</div>

<div style="padding-top:10px"><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL  POLICY STATEMENT:</strong></div>

It therefore requires and  encourages its staff to demonstrate a positive attitude to environmental  concerns.

                <li>make a commitment to environmental responsibility </li>
			    <li>assess and monitor the impact of their operations upon the environment </li>
