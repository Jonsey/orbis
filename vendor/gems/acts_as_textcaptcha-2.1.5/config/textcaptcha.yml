  # bcrypt can be used to encrypt valid possible answers in your session; http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/
  # (recommended if you are using cookie session storage)
  # NOTE: bcrypt_salt must be a valid bcrypt salt; for security PLEASE CHANGE THIS, open irb and enter; require 'bcrypt'; BCrypt::Engine.generate_salt
  bcrypt_salt: $2a$10$j0bmycH.SVfD1b5mpEGPpe
  # an optional logarithmic var which determines how computational expensive the hash is to calculate (a cost of 4 is twice as much work as a cost of 3)
  bcrypt_cost: 10 # default is 10, must be > 4 (large number means slower encryption)
  # if you'd rather NOT use bcrypt, just remove these two settings, bcrypt_salt and bcrypt_cost, valid possible answers will be MD5 digested in your session
